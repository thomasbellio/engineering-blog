# About

This contains posts and tutorials that I have put together on various concepts related to software and systems engineering. I have opted to create this blog in a repository, because, well, why not. Markdown makes a great format for conveying technical information and by using `git` I can easily make changes to posts and track those changes with minimum effort. Finally this saves me the trouble of having to learn how to manage a wordpress site, yuck. 

The organization of this repo is subject to change, but for now I will include each blog post in the root of this repository in a markdown file with a name relevant to the topic at hand. Below I will keep a list of my posts linked within this repository. Additionally as needed I will include examples of technical implemenation in the [examples](./examples/) folder of this repository.
